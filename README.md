# serviceAreaDemographics
Example program that compares service area's clientele with the general population to find underserved populations in a geographic area. This example involves a company that serves disabled clients.

NOTE: The "Pennsville, Pittsylvania" city is a fictional city with fictional demographics. However, the example concept can be applied to any real city demographics.

At the start screen, the user can select whether to examine an office's clientele by "Geography" or "Demographics". The "Geography" button opens a screen where the user can then input data based on ZIP code. The "Demographics" button opens a dialog screen in which client data by demographic type is input. 

Once the user has input the data, he or she can click the "Input Client Data" button to populate the percentage of clients in the general population. Clicking on the "Compare Percentages" button compares the user data with the percentage of clientele served. 

The "Visualize Discrepencies" button draws up a dialog box that compares how the population of served clientele compares to the percentage to the general data. In this dialog box, the groups or areas with negative numbers show communities that are underserved by the office.
